# UserZoom .NET Technical Test
This is a sample project containing some scaffolding code for the UserZoom .NET Backend tech test.

Feel free to use as much or as little of it as you want. You may even discard the code completely and
roll your own solution! And remember, we do not require production-grade quality,
we may not even check if it runs, but use it to discuss with us your approach and possible solutions
to the problem.

Instructions regarding the test can be found in the INSTRUCTIONS.pdf file.

**Good luck!**
